This mod is mostly not functional

### Mina the Hollower
Adds Mina as a playable character. Not finished! Does not work completely with attack boosting items! Mina's ability attacks an extra tile away.

### ArchipelagoPD
Mod api seems to not allow calls to certain methods, websocket/filehandling features are unavailable because of this an archipelago mod is most likely impossible
